Things to fix: 
*-Links from cart giving 404 in deployed version*
-It's not just links from cart giving 404, it seemed to be due to a Content-Security-Policy issue. When deployment gets updated will check to see if issue has been fixed.
-Deployed version using an earlier version despite pushing(actually need to confirm this, could possibly be using current version but useParams() is giving a different value during my test)
-At least make text responsive
-Add some sort of 404 error when going to page that doesn't exist
-add animation to cart opening and closing
