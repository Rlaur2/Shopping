Things to fix: 
-Links from cart giving 404 in deployed version
-At least make text responsive
-Deployed version using an earlier version despite pushing(actually need to confirm this, could possibly be using current version but useParams() is giving a different value during my test)
-Add some sort of 404 error when going to page that doesn't exist
-add animation to cart opening and closing
